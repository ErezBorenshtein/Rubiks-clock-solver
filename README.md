# Rubik's Clock Solver Robot

## Overview
The robot was meticulously designed and programmed to solve the Rubik's Clock puzzle in record time, showcasing precision engineering and advanced programming techniques.

## Features
- **Precision Mechanisms:** Powered by Nema 17 Bipolar 0.9Â° stepper motors for high accuracy.
- **Solving Algorithm:** Optimized algorithm for determining the quickest solution.
- **Hardware Components:**
  - Arduino Mega for robot control
  - Teensy 4.1 for LED display management
  - JF-0530B solenoids for precise movement
  - 4TB-8800TB motor driver
  - 32x64 LED display for status updates
- **Autonomous Operation:** Fully automated solving process from start to finish, not including clock's recognition.

## Hardware Setup
1. **Motors:** Connect the Nema 17 stepper motors to the motor driver.
2. **Solenoids:** Interface the JF-0530B solenoids with the Arduino Mega.
3. **Microcontrollers:**
   - Use the Arduino Mega as the main controller for the robot.
   - Use the Teensy 4.1 to control the 32x64 LED screen.
4. **LED Screen:** Mount the screen to display solving steps and timings.
5. **Power Supply:** Ensure stable power for all components.
